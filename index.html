                    <p>Many people at that time thought that physics wasn’t a good
                        subject for women to study. They thought women couldn’t handle
                        it, and some people at Stanford agreed. One male professor
                        is said to have stood up and declared, “What are these
                        girls doing here? You are taking jobs away from men!”
                        But Sally persisted, because she knew what she wanted.
                        She had been raised to believe she could do anything
                        a man could do.”— Atia Abawi</p>
